# Adopt A Bot

Alyssa Durdey

This is the README file for the entire project. For more official projects you should write information here about the nature of the project, your name, any special explanations of how the project works, etc.

This project plays with sound recognition by allowing the user to control the robot through voice commands. I initially had a completely different idea and concept for this project and ended up changing my mind last minute because I was no longer inspired by it. I liked the idea of encountering a robot, and having the user figure out what to do by finding hidden instructions.

This simulation may look simple but I ran into many problems with the code. The inital robot images I drew (which took a few days) were actually in the form of GIFS, which made the robot more lively. I loved the way it looked, but unfortunately the files were too big for my program to work seamlessly. Bugs I have never seen before popped up because there was not enough space to run the program. I fixed this by simplifying the GIFS into image PNG's. Then, I began by putting all my images into an array. I am still struggling to understand how to write arrays. I understand what they do and how they work, but I have a hard time to realize them. It took me many tries and questions asked before I decided to simply display the images using "if" statements. Finally, I was not able to display my paper images on clicks. Once again, after many questions asked, and researching examples I realized I was calling variables instead of the images themselves. In the end, I'm really happy and proud of my prototype and would love to keep adding more hidden features which would add to the robot's backstory and add somekind of ending.
