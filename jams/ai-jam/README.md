# Bear-y Hungry

I originally had planned to have the player go through three rounds of finding the coordinates (to simulate three dealy meals) but due to the lack of time, I focused on getting one game functioning. Secondly, I would have liked the hidden coordinates to generate randomly every round, but I was having difficulty getting them to generate once so I stuck to one hardcoded set of coordinates.

The background image of the forest was created through an AI with the prompt "forest" un an anime art style. The other images, such as the wooden signs, bees, and banana peel were drawn by me using Procreate. Ideally, I would have wanted all images to be drawn by hand but I did not have enough time. I attempted to draw the background but I was getting frustrated with how it was turning out.
